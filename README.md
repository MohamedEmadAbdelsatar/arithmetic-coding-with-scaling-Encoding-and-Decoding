# arithmetic coding with scaling Encoding and Decoding

in the Encoder:
Enter number of symbols in the set, enter the symbols one by one then enter the probability of each symbol (it's sum should equal 1) the progeram will print the cdf of each symbol then the user will enter the sequence of symbols in numbers (first symbol you should enter 1 etc.) the the program will print the tag 

in the Decoder:
Enter number of symbols in the set, enter the symbols one by one then enter the probability of each symbol (it's sum should equal 1) the progeram will print the cdf of each symbol then the user will enter the sequence of symbols in numbers (first symbol you should enter 1 etc.) and the user should enter number of digits in the original string and enter the tag Added to it 1 in the right then the program will print original sequence
